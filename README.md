⚡ Kafka Streaming Project – Real-Time Data Pipelines
This project demonstrates how to build a simple real-time event streaming pipeline using Apache Kafka and Python.

📚 Project Overview
Simulates real-time event production (e.g., stock prices or weather data).

Streams data from a Python Kafka Producer into Kafka Topics.

Consumes data in real-time via a Python Kafka Consumer.


🛠️ Tools and Technologies Used
Apache Kafka, Python, kafka-python Library, Docker (optional), VS Code

Flow:

📥 Producer → publishes events to → 🧵 Kafka Topic → 📤 Consumer processes the events

🚀 How to Run
1. Start Kafka Server
If using Docker:

bash
docker-compose up -d
If running locally:
Start Zookeeper → Start Kafka Broker

2. Start Producer
bash
python producer/producer.py
3. Start Consumer
bash
python consumer/consumer.py
✅ You will see real-time event flow from producer to consumer.

🎯 Outcomes
Successfully streamed simulated events.

Demonstrated basic Kafka real-time architecture.

Set foundation for scaling to more advanced streaming pipelines.

📌 Notes
Ensure correct Kafka topic names between producer and consumer.

Handle connection errors and retries appropriately for production-ready systems.

🧠 Future Enhancements
Multiple producers/consumers (load testing)

Integration with Big Data platforms (Spark, HDFS)

Real-time dashboards (Grafana + Kafka Connect)
